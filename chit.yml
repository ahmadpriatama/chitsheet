chit: |+
  To initialize chit repositories
  
  $ chit --init
  
  This will be run automatically when you run chit for the first time. 
  
  To get a cheat sheet:
  
  $ chit [cheatsheet]
  
  To edit a cheat sheet, use the --edit/-e switch.
  
  $ chit [cheatsheet] --edit
  
  To add a cheat sheet, use the --add/-a switch.
  
  $ chit [cheatsheet] --add
  
  During editing a cheat sheet, empty the content will get the cheat sheet removed.
  
  A prefix '@' indicates the cheat sheet is in private mode. A private cheat sheet is kept in another repository.
  
  To get your private cheat sheet:
  
  $ chit @[cheatsheet]
  
  The prefix '@' works the same for both --edit/-e and --add/-a.
  
  The cheat sheet can be in a path. For example:
  
  $ chit mysql/select
  
  will get the cheat sheet 'select' under mysql.
  
  To show all the cheat sheets:
  
  $ chit [all|sheets]
  
  To show all the private cheat sheets:
  
  $ chit @[all|sheets]
  
  To find cheat sheets begin with 'name', use the --find/-f switch
  
  $ chit name --find
  
  To search cheat sheets content with 'text', use the --search/-s switch
  
  $ chit text --search
  
  To move or rename a sheet, use '--mv/-m' switch
  
  $ chit zsh_if zsh/if -m

  want to add a new one.
  * main: 
  * clone-from: where to get the public cheat sheets. You can use git://github.com/robin/chitsheet.git, which is a snap shoot of http://cheat.errtheblog.com/.
